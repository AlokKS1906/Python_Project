## Problem Statement

The Number Guessing Game project focuses on building an interactive console app. It lets users try to guess a secret number that the system picks at random. Players get just a set number of attempts to nail it. Right away, the game offers feedback to steer them, like saying to aim higher or lower next time. It also checks every input carefully to stop errors from happening or to block repeated guesses. When the game wraps up, it reviews the player's results in detail. That includes working out the odds of success and figuring how many more efficient tries might have been needed. Overall, this setup fills a gap for a solid learning experience. It helps strengthen core skills in coding, handling user data safely, and working out logical steps.
